* Tight encoding support

* Document the Tight protocol extensions in a text file. 

* Add GUI support for selecting JPEG quality etc

* Support selecting zlib compression from the client side (the old
  -compresslevel option)

* All other features from the TightVNC 1.3 series: Filetransfer etc

* Improve bandwidth tests: The routine only works when doing
  block reads, currently. If reading data pixel by pixel, or reading
  through a ZlibInStream, the bandwidth tests don't work.
