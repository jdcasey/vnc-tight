* The dialog boxes in the UNIX viewer isn't as modal as they should
  be. For example, sometimes, when opening the OptionsDialog from the
  login window, the OptionsDialog appears *behind* the login window. 

* Change version strings. 

* Perhaps change icons. 

* Tight encoding support

* Update vncviewer.man: many parameters are currently not documented. 

* When manually changing color level and running against an old server
  (Xvnc from TightVNC 1.2.9, for example), the user should perhaps be
  warned that vncviewer might crash. 

* Document the Tight protocol extensions in a text file. 

* All other features from the TightVNC 1.3 series: Filetransfer etc

* Consider adding the toolbar from http://lars.werner.no/vnc/.
