* When running the UNIX vncviewer on a host with a different byte
  order than the Xserver, the colors are incorrect. This happens when
  using color depth 24 ("cutZeros"). Basically, the problem is that 
  the RGB24_TO_PIXEL32 macro is wrong; we need to swap endianess
  in this situation. There seems to be something wrong with the local
  cursor handling as well. 

* Change version strings. 

* Tight encoding support

* Update vncviewer.man: many parameters are currently not documented. 

* When manually changing color level and running against an old server
  (Xvnc from TightVNC 1.2.9, for example), the user should perhaps be
  warned that vncviewer might crash. 

* Document the Tight protocol extensions in a text file. 

* All other features from the TightVNC 1.3 series: Filetransfer etc

* Consider adding the toolbar from http://lars.werner.no/vnc/. 

* Implement support for rfbEncodingXCursor. When this is finished, it
  should be safe to allow dynamic pixel format changes again, as long
  as we only orders new pixel formats after recieving a framebuffer
  update with real pixel data. 

* The vncviewer password dialog should probably display the server
  name in the password dialog windows title. Wish from Gaetano Giunta.
