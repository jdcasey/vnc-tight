Subject: Problems with timestamps in file transfers.

Hi list!

I'm writing some VNC client software that supports the the file
transfer extensions described in the rfbtight.tex document in
the svn repo. However, when I communicate with a TightVNC server
version 1.3.9 (WinVNC.exe) I get strange data for the modification
times of the files.

Specifically, in the FileListData message, I have understood
that directories are encoded as <size ~0, mod-time 0>. For
regular files I get the expected size, but the mod-time is
always 0xffffffe7 (-25) which seem totally bogus.

The next problem is more disturbing since you will get interop
problems if you fix it. In the last FileDownloadData message
(the one with raw-length = compressed-length = 0), the mod-time
is transmitted in little-endian byte order (at least my TightVNC
server does so). Since it's more problems fixing this than
documenting it, I think this endianness issue should be recorded
in the rfbtight.tex file.

(However, when you use FileUploadData you should transmit
  the mod-time in the expected big-endian network byte order.)

Cheers,
Peter
