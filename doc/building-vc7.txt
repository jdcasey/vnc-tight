How to build TightVNC with VC7 (Visual C++ .NET)
================================================


Introduction
------------

This text documents how to build TightVNC with VC7. 


The VC7 "Standard" Edition
--------------------------

The VC7 "Standard" Edition does not come with an optimizing
compiler. It is possible to use the compiler from the free Visual C++
Toolkit 2003, though. See
http://www.sawtoothdistortion.com/Articles/FreeOptimizingCompiler.html
for more information. (This documents assumes that you are using Method
Two.)


Building
--------

* Open vnc.dsw. Select "Yes to all". 

* Select Build->Configuration Manager->Active Solution
  Configuration->Release.

* In Solution Explorer, select all projects except
  "logmessages". Right-click, and select properties.

* Below Configuration Properties->C/C++->Precompiled Headers, select
  "Not Using Precompiled Headers". 

* If you are using the Standard Edition and would like to build with
  optimizations, select Configuration Properties->C/C++->Command Line
  and fill in "/O2". 

* Build Solution.
