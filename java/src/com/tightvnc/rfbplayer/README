RFB Session Player 0.7.0
========================

RFB Session Player is a Java application/applet for playing back RFB session
files in FBS format saved by such programs as VNC Reflector or rfbproxy.

Usage:  java RfbPlayer URL file:test.fbs position 5000
        java RfbPlayer URL http://remote.host/sessions/test.fbs


Applet Parameters
=================

--> "URL"

    Value: URL of the session file to play.
    Default: none (required parameter).

    This parameter tells the player which session file to play. Please note
    that if the player operates as an unsigned applet, it is able to play
    only files from the host where the applet was loaded from. It's a usual
    JVM security limitation.

--> "Position"

    Value: time in milliseconds.
    Default: 0.

    Set initial time position in the session file, in milliseconds.

--> "Open new window" (applicable only in the applet mode)

    Values: "Yes", "No".
    Default: "No".

    Operate in a separate window. This makes possible resizing the desktop,
    and adds scroll bars when necessary. If the server supports variable
    desktop size, the window will resize automatically when remote desktop
    size changes.

--> "Show controls"

    Values: "Yes", "No".
    Default: "Yes".

    Set to "No" if you want to get rid of the control panel at the top. 
    Please note that hiding the panel in current version makes playback
    impossible. :-)

--> "Defer screen updates"

    Value: time in milliseconds.
    Default: "20".

    When updating the desktop contents after reading each update, schedule
    repaint within the specified number of milliseconds. Small delay helps to
    coalesce several small updates into one drawing operation, improving CPU
    usage. Set this parameter to 0 to disable deferred updates.
